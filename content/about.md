I am a brazilian developer and entrepreneur. I dropped out of the Computer Science course at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo to work on my company, but I missed studying mathematics, so I came back.

These days I am interested in machine learning, continuous optimization and applications of CS and math to other sciences.
