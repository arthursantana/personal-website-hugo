I am a brazilian developer and entrepreneur. I dropped out of the Computer Science course at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo to work on my company, but I hope to get back to it soon.

These days I am really interested in machine learning and continuous optimization. I also like game developing, but don't take it seriously.
